# Angular form testing: Server

This is a simple HTTP service based on Node.js and Express. It implements a fake backend for the sign-up form testing. This service does nothing useful and just simulates input validation and signup. Do not use it in production.

## Setup

- Install the dependencies with `npm install`.
- Start the server with `npm start`. The server runs at http://localhost:3000.
- Start the client Angular application in `../client/`. The form uses the HTTP service.
