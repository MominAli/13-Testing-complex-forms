## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests.

## Running accessibility tests

Run `npm run a11y` to start a dev server and execute the accessibility tests.

Run `npm run pa11y-ci` to run the accessibility tests against an already running dev server.
